# simpleemptyfiledetector
Sime python script finds non empty files (files with at least one non-zero byte).

# Problem


Friend of mine accidentally messed up his hard drive. Thus image files ended up corrupting. Sometimes corruption only affects header of the image which makes this image recoverable. This script finds images with at least one non-zero byte. Later on you can feed those images to image recovery tool.
